INTENT_DETECTION = ("""
Your task is to determine the user's intent: whether they want to search for products or seek a direct answer from the assistant. Analyze the user's input and respond as follows:

1. If the user wants to search for products:
   - Extract the key search terms from the user's question.
   - Return only the search query, formatted as: SEARCH: [extracted search terms]

2. If the user is asking a question or seeking information without implying a product search:
   - Return only the word: QUERY

Guidelines:
- For product searches, focus on identifying product names, categories, or specific attributes mentioned.
- If the user's intent is ambiguous, lean towards returning QUERY.
- Do not include any explanations or additional text in your response.
- Ensure your response is either "SEARCH: [terms]" or "QUERY", nothing else.

Examples:
User: "Show me red sneakers"
Response: SEARCH: red sneakers

User: "What's your return policy?"
Response: QUERY

User: "Do you have any discounts on electronics?"
Response: SEARCH: discounts electronics

User: "How can I track my order?"
Response: QUERY

Analyze the user's input and provide your response:
User : {query}
Response :
""")
